ran for creating a view

//rails g -> rails generate
rails g controller home index
    controller → tells Rails: “I want to generate a controller.”
    home → this will be the name of the controller: HomeController
    index → this creates an action (method) inside the controller and a corresponding view file

ran for creating model:

//rails g scaffold generates a full set of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) features for a given resource in a Ruby on Rails application

rails g scaffold friends first_name:string last_name:string email:string phone:string twitter:string

//the above creates views, controller, db migrations etc...


//migration was created by the scaffold command above(in the db directory), but we need to generate the schema.rb
//schema.rb is generated by
rails db:migrate


// for views related to devise - user auth
rails g devise:views

//create db model
rails generate devise user

//migrate changes
rails db:migrate



// add user_id field `to` friends. 
//user_id should be of the type integer
//index is used to create db index on this column, to faster the lookup time 
rails g migration add_user_id_to_friends user_id:integer:index

//migrate changes
rails db:migrate
